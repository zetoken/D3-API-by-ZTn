=============

Diablo3 API wrapper written in C# by ZTn

This project, dedicated to the game Diablo 3, is divided into 3 main parts:
* D3 API: an API object oriented written in C# allowing to retrieve Diablo 3 profile information from blizzard site.
* D3 Profile Explorer: a GUI application allowing to retrieve profile datas and show them in a tree.
* D3 Calculator: an API allowing DPS calculation based on stuff and buffs and a GUI integrated in D3 Profile Explorer.

All core libraries are portable libraries (PCL) and can be used under Windows, Linux and Android (iOS could be available but having no iOS machine I can't write a dedicated PCL Wrapper).

Have a look at the [wiki](home) for more information.
